# Data Structures & Algorithms

Javascript implementations of some classic data structures & algorithms. Most
of these, I am learning from a Coursera course, taught with Java.

## The menu

### Data structures

* Linked List
  * singly-linked
* Queue
  * linked list implementation
* Quick Find
* Quick Union
  * unweighted implementation
  * weighted implementation
* Stack
  * array implementation
  * linked list implementation

### Sorting algorithms

* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
  * variations with/without 3-way partitioning
* Selection sort
* Shell sort

Much of the decision making inside the algorithm itself has been abstracted
out into a library: [total-sorta](https://www.npmjs.com/package/total-sorta).

### Other things

Find these under `lib/misc/`

* Fisher-Yates shuffle
* Dijkstra's two-stack algorithm

## Usage

Run any of these commands in the terminal from the project root.

### Install dependencies

`npm install`

### Run tests

`npm test`

I'm following an online course in algorithms & data structures, the one with
